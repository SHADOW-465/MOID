// Every mutating API route must authorize at its own boundary.
//
// `src/proxy.ts` authenticates (valid session or 401) but is role-blind, so it
// cannot tell an Owner marked "View only" apart from a GM. Capability checks
// therefore live in the handlers — and Next is explicit that proxy "should not
// be used as a full session management or authorization solution", so there is
// deliberately no blanket authorization net above them.
//
// That makes "someone adds a route and forgets the guard" the live risk: the
// route would still require a session, but every signed-in role would get the
// full run of it. This test is the backstop. It walks the route tree rather
// than checking a hand-written list, so a new route is covered the moment it
// exists.
