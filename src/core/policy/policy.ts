// Calculation policy — the conventions behind every number, owned by the GM
// instead of buried in a code comment. See docs/CALCULATION-POLICY-PLAN.md.
//
// Not a rules engine: a fixed list of named decisions, each an enum or a
// number. Zod-validated, so no screen ever has to defend against a bad policy.
//
// Policy is a READ-TIME LENS. Changing it never touches the ledger — every
// screen just recomputes the same append-only events a different way.

/**
 * NOT configurable — the rejection formula itself is locked. See
 * `docs/CALCULATION-POLICY-PLAN.md`.
 *
 *   rate    = Σ over sections ( section rejected ÷ section checked )
 *   checked = Σ over sections ( that section's entry gate )
 *
 * Sections (Primary / Secondary / Assembly) are separate populations, so their
 * rates add. Gates INSIDE a section are sequential — what Visual accepts is what
 * Balloon checks — so the section is measured once at its entry gate, gate
 * rejects are summed, and gate rates are never added.
 *
 * This used to be two enum settings (`headlineRejection`, `checkedMeasuredAt`).
 * Between them, 8 of the 9 combinations were arithmetically incoherent — a
 * headline % whose denominator disagreed with the Checked KPI beside it — and
 * because policy is a read-time lens, flipping one silently rewrote every
 * historical report with nothing on the page saying which convention produced
 * it. Old stored policies still load: z.object drops the removed keys.
 *
 * Reconciling against the legacy YEARLY / REJECTION ANALYSIS sheet (which added
 * each gate's rate) belongs in the drill-down as a comparison line, not as a
 * global switch.
